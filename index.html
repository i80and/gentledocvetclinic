			<h1>Current News</h1>
			<ul id="newslist">
				<li><span class="paratitle">Thinking About a New Puppy?</span> A new canine friend can be a wonderful addition to a household, but do your homework to make sure you are prepared.  Take into consideration the genetics of what a breed has been selected for over the years.  Some dogs are running machines and need lots of physical activity to avoid behavior problems and obesity.  Some have airways that are not suitable for being a jogging partner.  Others will follow their nose wherever it leads, even into trouble.  Make sure your budget can handle dog food, boarding, grooming, training and daily dog care if you choose, along with veterinary expenses.</li>
				<li><span class="paratitle">Thinking About a New Kitten?</span> If you currently have a cat, take into consideration potential health risks in introducing a new cat with upper respiratory infections, feline leukemia or parasites.  Socialization occurs much younger in kittens than puppies, so there may already be some difficult patterns established.  Stress for cats can cause physical illness, so make sure they are active, have new places to explore, adequate territory and novel predatory play outlets.  The Indoor Pet Initiative listed in resources is an excellent reference.  Adult cats from rescue groups are always available and it can be easier to see if their personalities match your lifestyle.</li>
				<li><span class="paratitle">Nutriceuticalsâ€”Are They Really What the Label Says?</span> These products include vitamins, herbs, joint supplements, etc. and not all of them actually contain what the label says.  If they do contain the ingredients as labeled, there can still be issues of purity, concentration and toxic residues.  For example, fish oils may have high levels of mercury or other toxins.  An herb grown in one location may not have the same concentration of the active ingredient as another location due to soil types, rainfall and temperature.  There are some good products out there, but you need to do research  to see if the manufacturers submit to independent testing for quality.  </li>
